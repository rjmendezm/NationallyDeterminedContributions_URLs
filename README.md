# NationallyDeterminedContributions_URLs
Database with URLs to pdf documents with the *Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)*: the National Governments' decarbonization target and strategy as submitted to the [NDC_Registry](https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/NDCStaging/Pages/All.aspx) for complying with the [Paris Agreement](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement)'s Article 4, paragraph 12.  **It was created in Python by Web Scraping the NDC_Registry as shown in the attached Jupyter Notebook**.

Notes:
1. All country members of the European Union publish a single join NDC and updates of it, that is why they do not appear individually in the database.
2. UK presents its own NDC from 2020 onwards, before it adopted the join NDC of the European Union's members referred in note 1.
